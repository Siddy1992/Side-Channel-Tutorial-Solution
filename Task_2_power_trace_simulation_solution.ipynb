HD) of the plaintext."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"aEcc8v5B1Ped","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615463017717,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":775,"user":{"displayName":"Siddhartha Chowdhury","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GiezaBLAPOIVJu4zLgw4LH22hWzIVcpu8p-mT2v=s64","userId":"16148520356234632351"}},"outputId":"4f5a509c-8dce-4b7a-ff59-bfecbd172fae"},"source":["print(filename)\n","with open(filename, mode='r') as trace_file:\n","\ti = 0\n","\ttrace_reader = csv.reader(trace_file, delimiter=',')\n","\tfor row in trace_reader:\n","\t\tprint(row)\n","\t\ti = i + 1\n","\t\tif i == 10: break"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["trace_file_hw.csv\n","['c533fcab890b24bdf7c071363c2072b7', '71', '71', '68', '65', '70', '64', '60', '60', '63', '57', '57', '65']\n","['4d71174553123da4af77bf9d6d4f6968', '53', '49', '69', '68', '60', '58', '63', '65', '68', '66', '60', '70']\n","['8eae86be598aee3245b46cd7b35c4fdc', '64', '62', '70', '68', '69', '66', '71', '63', '70', '62', '64', '70']\n","['84f8063a8135ce1e70b3d6ec3928d957', '63', '57', '53', '64', '74', '61', '58', '72', '72', '64', '60', '62']\n","['7fe041c8db9ccf0031554a012d7c3d22', '60', '56', '64', '65', '60', '65', '65', '58', '65', '67', '66', '58']\n","['23cf7c7a7c533830994cf6d3b73e0d5f', '64', '60', '74', '72', '55', '58', '62', '60', '62', '67', '61', '71']\n","['96a8b28d05bd93926171b810527851ee', '60', '62', '62', '74', '61', '65', '68', '70', '65', '69', '66', '58']\n","['f995b26ff4a44e533c6590a282b8aa1c', '50', '52', '60', '70', '52', '55', '68', '72', '54', '60', '66', '62']\n","['04be0573a2e609c520121374fede4327', '66', '60', '58', '60', '53', '63', '66', '54', '56', '66', '71', '58']\n","['b6c9dce405813f757e9c143d28f625b0', '66', '68', '60', '63', '69', '51', '58', '64', '62', '65', '76', '64']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
